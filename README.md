# australian-rivers
Every mapped stream and river in Australia! Map created with [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) using data for 1.3 million streams from [Geoscience Australia GEODATA TOPO 250K](#data) vector datasets. Many arid-zone rivers and streams in these maps are highly ephemeral, and may only flow once every few years or even decades. Streams are weighted by both ephemerality (perennial or non-perennial) and hierarchy (minor or major), with the highest weighting for major perennial rivers (i.e. Murray River).
